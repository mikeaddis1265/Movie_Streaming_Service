  2. DATABASE STRUCTURE (prisma/schema.prisma)

  Let me explain each database table:

  User Table (Lines 37-56)

  model User {
    id             String           @id @default(cuid())  // Unique user ID
    name           String?                                 // User's full name
    email          String?          @unique               // Unique email
    emailVerified  DateTime?                              // When email was verified
    image          String?                                // Profile picture URL
    password       String?                                // Hashed password
    username       String?          @unique               // Unique username
    role           Role             @default(USER)        // USER or ADMIN
    createdAt      DateTime         @default(now())       // Account creation time
    updatedAt      DateTime         @updatedAt            // Last update time
  }

  Why each field exists:
  - id: Unique identifier for each user
  - email & password: For login functionality
  - emailVerified: To ensure valid email addresses
  - role: To differentiate between regular users and admins
  - image: For profile pictures from Google OAuth

  Watchlist Table (Lines 58-68)

  model WatchlistItem {
    id        String    @id @default(cuid())
    userId    String                           // Links to User
    tmdbId    Int                             // Movie ID from TMDB API
    mediaType MediaType                       // MOVIE or TV
    addedAt   DateTime  @default(now())       // When added to watchlist
  }

  Purpose: Stores movies users want to watch later

  Viewing History Table (Lines 70-85)

  model ViewingHistory {
    id        String    @id @default(cuid())
    userId    String
    tmdbId    Int
    progress  Float?                          // How much of movie watched (0-1)
    watchedAt DateTime  @default(now())       // When they watched
  }

  Purpose: Tracks what users have watched and their progress (like Netflix's "Continue Watching")

  Subscription Table (Lines 112-125)

  model Subscription {
    userId             String             @unique
    planId             Int                        // Which subscription plan
    status             SubscriptionStatus         // ACTIVE, CANCELED, etc.
    currentPeriodStart DateTime                   // Billing period start
    currentPeriodEnd   DateTime                   // When subscription expires
  }

  Purpose: Manages user subscriptions and billing cycles

  3. API ENDPOINTS EXPLAINED

  Authentication APIs (app/api/auth/)

  User Registration Process:

  1. User fills registration form
  2. API validates data using Zod schemas
  3. Password gets hashed with bcrypt
  4. wer in database
  5. Verification email sent via Resend

  Login Process:

  1. NextAuth handles authentication
  2. Supports email/password and Google OAuth
  3. Creates secure session with JWT tokens
  4. Redirects to homepage after success

  Movie APIs (app/api/movies/)

  Browse Movies (app/api/movies/browse/route.ts):

  // This endpoint handles movie browsing with filters
  export async function GET(request) {
    // Get query parameters (page, genre, category)
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);

    // Fetch from TMDB API based on filters
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${category}`);

    // Return formatted movie data
    return NextResponse.json(response.data);
  }

  Why this exists: Users need to browse different categories of movies (popular, trending, top-rated)

  User Data APIs (app/api/users/[id]/)

  Watchlist Management:

  // Add to watchlist
  POST /api/users/[id]/watchlist
  // Remove from watchlist
  DELETE /api/users/[id]/watchlist
  // Get user's watchlist
  GET /api/users/[id]/watchlist

  How it works:
  1. User clicks "Add to Watchlist" on a movie
  2. Frontend sends POST request to API
  3. API creates WatchlistItem record in database
  4. User sees movie in their watchlist page

  ---
  4. FRONTEND COMPONENTS EXPLAINED

  Homepage (app/page.tsx) - Lines 17-135

  Data Fetching (Lines 24-39):

  const [popular, nowPlaying, trending, topRated] = await Promise.all([
    fetchMovies(),           // Gets popular movies
    fetchNowPlayingMovies(), // Gets currently playing movies
    fetchTrendingMovies(),   // Gets trending movies
    fetchTopRatedMovies()    // Gets highest rated movies
  ]);

  Why Promise.all(): Fetches all movie categories simultaneously for faster loading

  Error Handling (Lines 41-55):

  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="homepage-error">
        <h2>Failed to load movies</h2>
        <p>Make sure to set your TMDB_API_KEY environment variable.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  Purpose: Shows helpful error message if movie data fails to load

  Movie Sections (Lines 67-129):

  Each section displays 10 movies in a grid:
  - Featured Movie: Large banner at top
  - Trending Now: Currently popular movies
  - Now Playing: Movies in theaters
  - Popular Movies: All-time popular movies
  - Top IMDb: Highest rated movies

  Movie Card Component:

  function MovieCard({ movie }) {
    return (
      <div className="movie-card">
        <img src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500${movie.poster_path}`} />
        <h3>{movie.title}</h3>
        <p>Rating: {movie.vote_average}/10</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  Purpose: Reusable component to display movie information consistently
